## Current Projects


**Phase 4,5&6 Arden Service Area Pipe and Meter Installation Project, Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA)**

Project Role: Associate Engineer (2021 - Present)

D&A is providing design plans, specifications, and cost estimate for approximately 80,000 feet of new 12-inch, 10-inch and 8-inch DIP mainline.  The project abandons old undersized backyard mains and includes replacing fire hydrants, reconnecting interties, reconnecting wells and 1,300 metered service reconnections. Engineering services also include pipeline design, water system modeling, engineering services during construction and utility coordination.


**Motherlode Force Main, Phase 2, 3, and 4, El Dorado Irrigation District**

Project Role: Associate Engineer (2021 - Present)

Prepared contract plans and specifications for approximately 5,700 linear-feet of 18-inch DR 18 PVC force main within El Dorado County right-of-way and EID property. The design is the first of three phases to replace the remain portions of AC pipe force main that is being replaced.  The Design included two main connections to existing force main pipe; reconnection of two pump to sewer lateral; realignment of 12-inch water main found to be in conflict; realignment of an EID 2-inch water service line; and replacement of a 6-inch gravity sewer. 


## Old Projects

**Alta Loop Pipeline – Cable Road Water Main Replacement Project – Placer County Water Agency (PCWA)**

Project Role: Associate Engineer (2021 - 2022)

Design complete and awaiting construction. Project includes design of a 6-inch PRV station and 4,660 linear-feet of 8-inch ductile iron pipeline within residential streets. The design included mainline replacement of old undersized main, replacing fire hydrants and reconnecting 42 residential metered services. The project required establishing an extensive water system model from the source to analyze the distribution system and confirm fire flows and PRV pressure settings.


**Greenberry – Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD)**

Project Role: Associate Engineer (2021 - 2022)

D&A analyzed the water system supplying the Greenberry apartment complex and provided SSWD with recommendations for its replacement. The analysis included preparing a hydraulic model and creating four different scenarios of pipe networks. The scenarios included minor upgrades and connections, individual meters, master meters, and full upsizing and replacement of all water mains. D&A prepared a technical report for the study which included the construction costs of different scenarios as well as a cost impact analysis factoring connection costs and metering rates for the homeowner’s association to remain a public or become a private water system.


**State Streets Water Capacity and Sewer Rehabilitation Project, City of West Sacramento (CoWS)**

Project Role: Associate Engineer (2021 - 2022)

The design includes preparing plans, specifications, and cost estimate for approximately 10,000 feet of new water main and rehabilitating approximately 38,000 feet of gravity sewer main within the CoWS State Street area. The prepared Contract Documents will allow CoWS to bid both the water mains and sewer main rehabilitations as a single project.


**Stanley Avenue Water Main Replacement Project, Carmichael Water District**

Project Role: Associate Engineer (2021 - 2022)

Construction completed in 2020. Prepared design and contract documentation for approximately 1,900 feet of 16-inch ductile iron pipe and 1,100 feet of 8-inch ductile iron pipe, 59 new metered service connection, fire hydrant replacement, two new 4-inch meters with backflow devices, a water sampling station, and a combination air valve. All work occurred within residential streets under Sacramento County jurisdiction. 


**Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems**

Collaborators: Dr. Chad Higgins, Dr. Anne Nolin, Dr. Stephen Drake, Dr. David Rupp

Funding: National Science Foundation (2021 - 2022)

Years: (2018 - 2021)

The Willamette INFEWS project is a research effort, funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation and led by Oregon State University.  The project focuses on the Willamette River Basin, a 11,600 mi2 (30,000 km2) watershed with diverse land use and a history of intensive study and integrated modeling.  Within the context of this basin, this project asks: What are the tradeoffs and adaptation pathways that will help us satisfy competing ecological demands while also securing food, water and energy for a growing population?

**NASA SnowEx**

Collaborators: Dr. Anne Nolin, Jack Tarricone

Funding: NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program

Years: (2019 - 2020)

SnowEx is a five year program initiated and funded by NASA THP to address the most important gaps in snow remote sensing knowledge. It focuses on airborne campaigns and field work, and on comparing the various sensing technologies, from the mature to the more experimental, in globally-representative types of snow. The goal is to address the most important gaps in our snow remote sensing knowledge, and thus lay the groundwork for a future snow satellite mission.

**McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antartica Stream Team, MCM LTER**

Collaborators: Dr. Dian McKnight, Dr. Michael Gooseff, Zach Sudman

Funding: National Science Foundation, United State Antarctic Program

Years: (2015-2016) & (2016-2017)

The McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER project is an interdisciplinary study of the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in a cold desert region of Antarctica. In 1992 this area was selected as a study site within the National Science Foundation's Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) Program.

**Arikaree Environmental Lab, INSTAAR**

Years: (2013-2014)

The Arikaree Environmental Lab is the environmental chemistry lab for the Niwot Ridge Long-Term Ecological Research site.  The lab can analyze water, snow, soil, and air samples for major solutes and nutrients.  Equipment includes an ion chromatograph, atomic absorption spectrometer, total organic carbon analyzer, spectrophotometric flow injection analyzer, and isotopic liquid water analyzer among other instruments.
