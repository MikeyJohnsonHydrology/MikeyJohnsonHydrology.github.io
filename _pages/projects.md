## Current Projects ##

**MacKay and Somps Drainage Report Development**  (2021-Present)

D&A has subcontracted with MacKay and Somps to provide drainage design, calculations, and studies for development projects throughout the Sacramento region. D&A has provided over 100 studies in the region, many of which are for projects in Sacramento County DWR jurisdiction. Level 1, Level 2, and Level 4 studies have been prepared following the County’s drainage study requirements, both before and after the 2020 requirements document. In all cases, hydrology and hydraulics follow the County Drainage Manual Volume 2 and improvement plan Section 9 (Storm Drain Design. Drainage studies performed in the last five years have also considered the Sacramento Stormwater Quality Partnership Hydromodification Management Plan and the Sacramento Region Stormwater Quality Design Manual. D&A has taken a comprehensive approach to drainage design to incorporate low-impact development, stormwater quality, hydromodification, and flood control. Example projects in Sacramento County include: Newbridge Master Plan, Mather South Master Plan, Folsom Plan Area Master Plan, Elverta Specific Plan Level 2 studies, Caselman North Level 2 Study, Cordova Hills Level 2 Study, Gardner Parke Level 3 study, and many others. Having a vast array of experience in drainage design, models, and development of drainage studies allows D&A to review these elements of development with a keen eye on not only the standards, but good drainage design to ensure both public safety and long-term operations and maintenance.

Working under a professional engineer, I regularly develop pre and post-condition hydraulic models, develop 10-year and 100-year hydrology, and write hydraulic reports and technical memorandum.



**San Joaquin County Bridge Hydrologic and Hydraulic Analysis and Reports**  (2021-Present)

D&A has provided Hydraulic Location Studies for several bridge designs throughout the County including Airport Road over the San Joaquin River, Buckman Road Bridge over Duck Creek, and Miller’s Ferry Bridge over the Mokelumne River.

Working under a professional engineer, my work involves hydraulic modeling and report writing to inform the design of bridges, floodplains, and scour.



**Phase 4,5, &6 Arden Service Area Pipe and Meter Installation Project, Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA)**(2021 - Present)

D&A is providing design plans, specifications, and cost estimate for approximately 80,000 feet of new 12-inch, 10-inch and 8-inch DIP mainline.  The project abandons old undersized backyard mains and includes replacing fire hydrants, reconnecting interties, reconnecting wells and 1,300 metered service reconnections. Engineering services also include pipeline design, water system modeling, engineering services during construction, and utility coordination.

My roles include QA/QC of the existing utility maps and drafting the design of the pipeline plan and profile views.



**Rancho Murieta - Comunity Developmnet Plan and Mainaance**  (2021 - Present)

Providing review and comment for development plans and their associated drainage studies, sewer studies and water studies on behalf of RMCSD. Projects completed include Riverview Phases 1 and 2, Residence East and West, Rancho Murieta North, and The Retreats. Additionally, D&A provided design for a major drainage outfall for RMCSD as an emergency project to drain major portions of the District to the Cosumnes River.  The project required a fast track design and construction schedule to establish the discharge system to the River before the 2022 winter. D&A also provides reviews and conditions for approval to meet MS4 permit compliance using County standards as a guide.

My work includes sytem reviews of storm drain design and sewer systems. Included storm drain sizing, slopes, and constructability. Pump station design was reviewed for adequate sizing and regulatory compliance.



## Old Projects

**Motherlode Force Main, Phase 3, El Dorado Irrigation District (EID)**  (2021 - 2023)

Desing complete and project out for bid.  Working under a princiap elgineer and project engineer, I Prepared contract plans and specifications for approximately 17,249 linear-feet of 18-inch and 20-inch DR 18 PVC force main within El Dorado County right-of way and EID property. The design includes three phases of replace the remaining portions of AC pipe force main and included desing plans for a horizontal directional drilling to reduce impact to riparian wetland.



**Alta Loop Pipeline – Cable Road Water Main Replacement Project – Placer County Water Agency (PCWA)**  (2021 - 2022)

Design complete and awaiting construction. Working under a principal engineer I prepaired contart plans for the design of a 6-inch PRV station and 4,660 linear-feet of 8-inch ductile iron pipeline within residential streets. The design included mainline replacement of old undersized main, replacing fire hydrants and reconnecting 42 residential metered services. The project required establishing an extensive water system model from the source to analyze the distribution system and confirm fire flows and PRV pressure settings.



**Greenberry – Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD)**  (2021 - 2022)

D&A analyzed the water system supplying the Greenberry apartment complex and provided SSWD with recommendations for its replacement. The analysis included preparing a hydraulic model and creating four different scenarios of pipe networks. The scenarios included minor upgrades and connections, individual meters, master meters, and full upsizing and replacement of all water mains. D&A prepared a technical report for the study which included the construction costs of different scenarios as well as a cost impact analysis factoring connection costs and metering rates for the homeowner’s association to remain a public or become a private water system.



**State Streets Water Capacity and Sewer Rehabilitation Project, City of West Sacramento (CoWS)**  (2021 - 2022)

The design includes preparing plans, specifications, and cost estimate for approximately 10,000 feet of new water main and rehabilitating approximately 38,000 feet of gravity sewer main within the CoWS State Street area. The prepared Contract Documents will allow CoWS to bid both the water mains and sewer main rehabilitations as a single project.



**Stanley Avenue Water Main Replacement Project, Carmichael Water District**  (2021 - 2022)

Construction completed in 2020. Prepared design and contract documentation for approximately 1,900 feet of 16-inch ductile iron pipe and 1,100 feet of 8-inch ductile iron pipe, 59 new metered service connection, fire hydrant replacement, two new 4-inch meters with backflow devices, a water sampling station, and a combination air valve. All work occurred within residential streets under Sacramento County jurisdiction. 



**Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems**

Collaborators: Dr. Chad Higgins, Dr. Anne Nolin, Dr. Stephen Drake, Dr. David Rupp

Funding: National Science Foundation (2021 - 2022)

Years: (2018 - 2021)

The Willamette INFEWS project is a research effort, funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation and led by Oregon State University.  The project focuses on the Willamette River Basin, a 11,600 mi2 (30,000 km2) watershed with diverse land use and a history of intensive study and integrated modeling.  Within the context of this basin, this project asks: What are the tradeoffs and adaptation pathways that will help us satisfy competing ecological demands while also securing food, water and energy for a growing population?

**NASA SnowEx**

Collaborators: Dr. Anne Nolin, Jack Tarricone

Funding: NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program

Years: (2019 - 2020)

SnowEx is a five year program initiated and funded by NASA THP to address the most important gaps in snow remote sensing knowledge. It focuses on airborne campaigns and field work, and on comparing the various sensing technologies, from the mature to the more experimental, in globally-representative types of snow. The goal is to address the most important gaps in our snow remote sensing knowledge, and thus lay the groundwork for a future snow satellite mission.
