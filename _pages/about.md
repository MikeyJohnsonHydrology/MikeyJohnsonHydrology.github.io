I am Hydrologist and Engineer in Training living in Nevada Reno. My areas of interest are snow hydrology, streamflow generation, and mountain forest ecosystems.  I am specifically interested in engineering application of hydrologic processes to improve water use and availbility for natural and human ecosystems.
