I am Hydrologist and Engineer in Training living in Nevada Reno. My areas of interest are surface water hydrology, snow hydrology, streamflow generation, and ecosystems water use.  I am specifically interested in engineering application of hydrologic processes to improve water availbility for natural and human systems.

I ultimetly believe that proper planning and engineerign desing is a key step to insure water security.
