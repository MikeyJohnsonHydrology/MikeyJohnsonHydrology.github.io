I'm a PhD student in the Graduate Program of Hydrologic Sciences at the University of Nevada Reno. My areas of interest are snow hydrology, streamflow generation, and mountain forest ecosystems.  I am specifically interested in improved methods for snow modeling that will advance the accuracy of ecological and river forecast models.
