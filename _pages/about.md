I am Hydrologist and Engineer in Training living in Reno, Nevada. My areas of interest are snow hydrology, streamflow generation, surface water hydrology, ecosystem water use, and water resource management.  I am specifically interested in the engineering application of hydrologic processes to improve water availability for natural and human systems.

Ultimately, I believe that proper planning and engineering design is a crucial step to ensure water security.  The use of hydrologic models in engineering design is vital in the development of secure water systems.
