I am Hydrologist and Engineer in Training living near Sacramento, California. My areas of interest are snow hydrology, streamflow generation, surface water hydrology, ecosystem water use, and water resource management. I am specifically interested in the engineering application of hydrologic processes to improve water quality and availability for natural and human systems. Ultimately, I believe that proper planning and engineering design can are crucial components of ensuring clean and plentiful water for generations to come.
