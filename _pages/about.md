I am Hydrologist and Engineer in Training living in Sacramento, California. My areas of interest include; mountain hydrologic processes, surface water hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, and computational modeling. I am specifically interested in the engineering application of hydrologic processes at the intersection of people, progress, and the natural world. Forever optimistic, I believe that proper planning and creative engineering are crucial components to ensuring clean and plentiful water for generations to come.
