I am Hydrologist and Engineer in Training living near Sacramento, California. My areas of interest include; mountain hydrologic processes, surface water hydrology, computational modeling, and water resource engineering. I am specifically interested in the engineering application of hydrologic processes to improve water quality and availability for natural and human systems. Ultimately, I believe that proper planning and creative engineering design are the crucial components to ensuring clean and plentiful water for generations to come.
